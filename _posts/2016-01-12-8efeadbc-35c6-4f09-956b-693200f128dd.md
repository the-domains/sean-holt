# Hello!

So after my first post my initial thoughts are that the Grid.io has a long ways to go before it can really be used effectively. However here are some pros and cons.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pros: **

* I really like how the site changed Cortana to red. It was originally a blue photo, however becaused I specified I wanted the website to follow the colors found using this photo: 

It changed the photo to match accordingly. 

**Cons:**

* There is still a lot of work to do. First off, there is very little control over the website at all. For example the navigation system is entirely based off of a check box in the draft section of a post. 

* Inside the actual draft area to create posts there is almost nothing that allows you to customize the post. I cannot determine a header, links, photo dimensions. Actually that is a lie. As I was typing this I learned how to do all of what I just listed. You must highlight the text using your mouse and then select some options that appear above your highlighted text. Not sure how I feel about this. I think it might have been easier to have a navigation pane on the left hand side of the screen, though the more I use it the more I like the minimalist aspect. 

* The next con is that once you publish or make a change to the website, the changes are not immediate. This is somewhat expected given that it is designed via computer learning, AI, or whatever else you want to call it. But as a result there is a several minute lag which is annoying. **Update:** it can take a lot longer than a couple of minutes if you post something longer or with lots of images. 

* One of the issues I have seen so far with the AI color scheme is that if you define your sites layout based off a photo that does not have a vast color scheme almost all the colors used look the same making the site very blah. It might be interesting to have the AI browse a larger portion of the color than the basic 5/6 colors that it seems to use now. This would add some variety which I would argue would be very useful and make the page not look just red.  **Update:** To adapt to this problem, I am trying to use a more colorful photo to upload. If this doesn't work I am planning on uploading a custom color sheet that simply has square patches of the colors I want. This seems... silly to me that I should be having this issue, especially featuring this is one of the main aspects that the Grid.io has been focusing on. **Update:** By changing to a more colorful spectrum picture, the website became more colorful. However, it might have become too colorful. For example this post had a yellowish color that worked well, however the post below this one featuring an image of Cortana became much more of a dark blue than the original photo was really making it look ugly. I think it is super important then to create a color spectrum with lighter (greater white balance) colors. This sort of explains why all of the grid.io photos have this huge grainy white balance aspect. 

* One of the other issues is the writing on the main page that a posts a brief preview of your new blog post seems to be a set amount of characters. This annoys me for two reasons. 1st, I should be able to set length for each post. 2nd, it can look ugly. For example, when I posted this article the initial preview had the first paragraph, centered then a couple of line spaces followed by "Pros:" centered. It looked stupid. 

Overall I feel like there are just so few customization features that have been implemented that need to be implemented to really create useful sites from the Grid.io at this time.
