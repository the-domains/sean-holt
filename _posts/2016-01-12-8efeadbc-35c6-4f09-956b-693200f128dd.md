Hello!

So after my first post my initial thoughts are that the Grid.io has a long ways to go before it can really be used effectively. However here are some pros and cons.

Pros: 

I really like how the site changed Cortana to red. It was originally a blue photo, however becaused I specified I wanted the website to follow the colors found using this photo: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1c21ef2-41a2-4691-bdc4-96d521945804.jpg)

It changed the photo to match accordingly. 

Cons:

There is still a lot of work to do. First off, there is very little control over the website at all. For example the navigation system is entirely based off of a check box in the draft section of a post. 

Inside the actual draft area to create posts there is almost nothing that allows you to customize the post. I cannot determine a header, links, photo dimensions. Actually that is a lie. As I was typing this I learned how to do all of what I just listed. You must highlight the text using your mouse and then select some options that appear above your highlighted text. Not sure how I feel about this. I think it might have been easier to have a navigation pane on the left hand side of the screen.
